# Signature GAN
Implementation and numerical experiments of SigWGAN.

## User Guide
Users are welcome to check the notebooks to see the implementation details and numerical results. However, I did not make changes on test metrics functions and signature related functions in order to ensure runnable code.  

Datasets:
- Geometric Browian motion
- Rough Bergomi
- S\&P 500
